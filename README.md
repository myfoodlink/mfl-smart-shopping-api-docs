# Myfoodlink's Smart Shopping API

This API allows you to interact with the Myfoodlink API.

This API is commonly used by "headless" shops who build their own front-end, but use Myfoodlink as back-end.

### Documentation

Our API docs are automatically generated when our tests pass. That means they cover all edge cases we have tests for. üëç
